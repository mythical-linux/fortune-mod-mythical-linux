DrownNotably: just distract them by opening pornhub
dmt: ^ They'd probably be less disappointed.
dmt: At least you'd be displaying a healthy libido.

Dexter of Ebonheart: Can a MacBook be installed a Linux?
                     My brother tried to factory reset his MacBook and now it's 
                     stuck saying "no packages could be installed. Restart to continue" 
                     then it says that again when he reboots
                     I told him install Linux and he said 
                     "fuck it, I don't care as long as I can get online and watch porn"

DrownNotably:        depends on how new it is

Shardion:            also yes, you can linux a macbook, just not some recent ones
                     newer ones have this stupid security chip
                     blocks anything but macos from starting

Dexter of Ebonheart: He said about 10 years old. I'd have to get the exact model information from him

dmt:                 your 10 year old brother needs to get online to watch porn?
                     OH
                     
Shardion:            ANOTHER FOR THE FORTUNES LMAO

Dexter of Ebonheart: My brother is 29. He can go to porn stores. It's okay

Shardion: remember, stripping down windows with shit like Group Policies takes the spikes away from the cactus, but you still don't want a cactus in your ass
Phate6660: > you still don't want a cactus in your ass
           That is a legit fetish, I'm not even joking.

dmt: no need my friend, i keep my rust documentation right next to my porno mags
     sometimes when i'm really into a jerk sesh i mix them up, but I don't mind
%
Phate6660: I just don't fucking understand.
           On Linux it's as simple as do A to get B.
           With windows it's like:
           Okay, go to A, but instead of going to B go to Z instead.
           But then you need to take that Z and shove it up your ass real deep before you can transition over the sqaure root of X which
           will then allow you take a mystical journey of fucking yourself repeatedly before you can finally make it to B.
           And then in the end it STILL DOESNT FUCKING WORK.
           EVEN THOUGH THE CODE IS 100% RIGHT.
%
Phate6660: I'm about to say fuck it and add SLADE to my fucking shit list of programs.
           It's such a buggy piece of shit that it can't even find the right libraries even if I manually specify the paths of them.
           FUCK IT, I'M DONE.
           Fuck you SLADE, you suck.
           And you too wxGTK and wxWidgets.
           Time to remove the 50+ fucking packages I fucking installed for this stupid fucking piece of shit software.

Dexter of Ebonheart: inherited a thing when my brother left to go to texas for a few months. old jar was full of algae and the big nasty. cleaned it out, fixed up the roots and gave it some tasty distilled water. hopefully this grows into a nice cactus dildo
