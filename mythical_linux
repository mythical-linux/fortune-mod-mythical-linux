Arctic: Tredix is the king of boomers
Tredkip: Ye- no wait.
%
Arctic: Could we maybe have mods so this can be prevented in the future?
%
Arctic: I probably sound the like the ultimate boomer but when I use Arch I
        want to use Arch and when I use Debian I want to use Debian
%
Arctic: [Deleted bad joke]
%
Arctic: Just use your BIOS
        OSs are for noobs
Phate6660: Pffffft, using an OS is stupid.
           Obviously you need to hack into the mainframe using electromagnetic waves and control technology that way.
           Don't forget to use a block of wood to conduct electricity better.

Dexter of Ebonheart: I've never had any full on problems with systemd on mint. Just confusion when I tried to do something like `/etc/init.d/disdick restart`
Dexter of Ebonheart: But I was not a fan of the actual maintenance commands I needed to do things. And I don't like the direction it's heading. So no D for me.

dmt: hmmm
     if i could get a phone that just ran emacs
     that'd be the best
     It needs to be bare metal -> Kernel -> Emacs
     otherwise what's the point
Phate6660: That'll never happen unless you make it yourself.
dmt: Time to pull myself up by my boot straps
     Introducing... the ePhone
     :emacs:Phone
     I wonder if apple would sue
Dexter of Ebonheart: They would sue and claim it was their idea originally

Phate6660: Welp, I'm gonna go get coma-stoned, eat some food, and go to bed.
%
Phate6660: Honestly, I'd take Windows over using SystemD.
%
Phate6660: Honestly, the very concept of a country is stupid.
%
Phate6660: I love meat. I don't know what I'd do without it.
%
Phate6660: I think that over the course of my years of Linux, I had forgotten
           about why I really hated Windows. Over the course of these past few
           hours, not only have the flames of hatred been rekindled, but they
           are burning hotter and brighter than ever before.
%
Phate6660: The problem is that people just don't want to admit to themselves
           how evil and disgusting humanity is.

Phate6660: I JUST HAD THE BIGGEST DERP
           i was trying to figure out why the fuck mpc was skipping like 12 tracks at a time when switching to the next song

Phate6660: Pfffffft, netbooks are too still a thing.
Phate6660: Just a little while ago I bought a refurbished lenovo netbook locally for like ~$50.
...
Phate6660: Oh wait, I don't think it's Lenovo.
Phate6660: It was an ASUS EeePC.
Phate6660: That came with Windows XP.

Arctic: it looks kind of like a tiny macbook
Arctic: the old ones
Phate6660: Now I can never use it again, thank you.

Phate6660: Tfw all the comments on your post are about the music you're listening to and not the
           actual contents of the post itself.
%
Phate6660: Don't be a distroist, it's like the Linux equivalent of being a racist.
Shardion: So Arch users are the ultimate racists?
%
Phate6660: Tfw Gentoo and LFS are too easy but Debian is a hurdle you will never get over.
%
Phate6660: Who hurt you in your life so much that you would want to use Debian?
%
Phate6660: I gave up. Debian mentally broke me. It made me hate Linux for a while.
%
Phate6660: fdisk > cfdisk, parted
           Oh God I just had another ptsd flashback to fucking Void.
           I was forced to use fucking cfdisk to partition my disks.
           I hated every second of it.
           cfdisk is so god damn confusing, it makes no sense half the time.
           I almost gave up on the Void install like 6 times because of it.
           On top of being confusing, it's missing a lot of features that are available in fdisk.
           For example, the ability to change the disk label to MBR or GPT.

Phate6660: [meme about someone calling html a programming language]
Shardion: HTML is a markup language
Phate6660: Yeah, but people don't seem to understand that.
           I can't tell you how many times I've seen people call it a programming language.
           And every time I go: "DID YOU EVER EVEN READ THE FUCKING NAME!?"
           And they go: "...Uh............ HTML?"
%
Phate6660: OMG
           Look at the soliders chest
           Fucking Debian
           Lol
           Does this mean that Debian is a soldier for SystemD?

              sadly i cant hack him since i dont know how to either save or close VIM

Phate6660: Wha....
           Why...
           Are you using 15GBs on your SWAP partition?
Shardion: I have the space.
          Why not?
Phate6660: Does not compute.
Shardion: Yeah it won't with your puny 512MB swap

%
Phate6660: I feel like an idiot.
           I was playing DOOM and accidentally hit `A-S-q`.
           Which is bspwm's default quit keybinding.
           I forgot to change it to `C-A-del` like I usually do. [crying pepe with hands up emoji]
%
Phate6660: Holy shit. Somehow I played almost 300 songs yesterday. God damn.
%
Phate6660: Oh what the fuck... this is kinda creepy.
           I just loaded up DOOM like normal, but when I spawned in, every monster was already dead and there were no items in the level.(edited)
           Wtf. Doors are activating on their own, and now I'm seeing bodies of the player character.
           I swear I didn't change up any mods or anything.
           I just started it up like I usually do.
           What the hell. The monsters are already dead in the next level too.
           I don't know why, but there's just something really fucking creepy about this.
           DOOM just went from stress reliever to horror game.
           It's all ominous and shit.
Arctic: lol
        ~~inb4 DOOM became DOOM 3~~
%
Phate6660: Holy shit, I just realized something.
           All of my favorite Seether songs are all track 2 of the respective albums.
           That's some trippy shit.
